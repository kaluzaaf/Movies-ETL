## Movies

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to combine several data sources for our customer (Amazing Prime) in order to identify movies that could potentially be big hits if moved onto Amazing Prime's video streaming service.

### Approach
We were given two databases of movies to work with. The first was a database created from Wikipedia, the next was a database from Kaggle.com. This required us to merge the two databases, then clean up each to remove redundant entries or entries that were incomplete.

### Outcome
We were able to deliver a final product where we extracted, transformed, then loaded the information in the two databases into a single database that Amazing Prime can use to identify old movies that are well-liked and are flying under most people's radar. This will potentially allow Amazing Prime to purchase these movies for their streaming service at a low price, then leverage their popularity to increase their customer base (and revenues) in a cost-efficient way.
